Task:
Generate Cypher query for a Neo4j graph database.

Instructions:
Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.

Schema:
{schema}

Note:
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your reply.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything other than for you to construct a Cypher statement. 
Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement. 
Make sure the direction of the relationship is correct in your queries. 
Make sure you alias both entities and relationships properly. 
Do not run any queries that would add to or delete from the database. 
Make sure to alias all statements that follow as with statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as billing_amount)
If you need to divide numbers, make sure to filter the denominator to be non zero, this is important.

Examples:


Make sure to use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL when analyzing missing properties.
Never return embedding properties in your queries. You must never include the
statement "GROUP BY" in your query. Make sure to alias all statements that
follow as with statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as
billing_amount)
If you need to divide numbers, make sure to filter the denominator to be non-zero.
